   <p align=" justify">What is cocoyam? Cocoyam is a tropical perennial root vegetable cultivated mainly for its edible starchy corms or tubers, petioles and leaves. It is popularly known as taro or kalo in Hawaiian. Cocoyam belongs to the member of the Araceae family and it is botanically known as Colocasia esculenta or Xanthosoma sagittifolium. Taro is an ancient crop grown throughout the humid tropical regions. Cocoyam corms are often considered similar to yam tubers but they do differ from each other in several ways. Cocoyam is a common staple food especially in Africa and Asia, although other cultures do consume it. Both the cocoyam tubers, stems and leaves are an important source of carbohydrates for human nutrition and animal consumption</p>

   <p align=" justify"> A scale or balance is a device used to measure weight or mass. These are also known as mass scales, weight scales, mass balances, and weight balances.   The traditional scale consists of two plates or bowls suspended at equal distances from a fulcrum. One plate holds an object of unknown mass (or weight), while objects of known mass or weight, called weights, are added to the other plate until mechanical equilibrium is achieved and the plates level off, which happens when the masses on the two plates are equal. The perfect scale rests at neutral.A spring scale will make use of a spring of known stiffness to determine mass (or weight).</p>

<p align="justify"> A glucose meter, also referred to as a "glucometer",[1] is a medical device for determining the approximate concentration of glucose in the blood. It can also be a strip of glucose paper dipped into a substance and measured to the glucose chart. It is a key element of glucose testing, including home blood glucose monitoring (HBGM) performed by people with diabetes mellitus or hypoglycemia. A small drop of blood, obtained from slightly piercing a fingertip with a lancet, is placed on a disposable test strip that the meter reads and uses to calculate the blood glucose level. </p>

<p align="justify"> A sphygmomanometer also known as a blood pressure monitor, or blood pressure gauge, is a device used to measure blood pressure, composed of an inflatable cuff to collapse and then release the artery under the cuff in a controlled manner and a mercury or aneroid manometer to measure the pressure. Manual sphygmomanometers are used with a stethoscope when using the auscultatory technique.</p>

<h1> DIABETES </h1>

<p align="justify"> Diabetes is a condition that affects the body’s ability to use blood sugar for energy. <br> <h3> The three types are type 1, type 2, and gestational diabetes:</h3>
<br>
    Type 1 diabetes affects the body’s ability to produce insulin. Doctors usually diagnose in childhood, although it can occur in adults also. The hormone insulin is vital to helping the body utilize blood sugar. Without enough insulin, the extra blood sugar can damage the body. According to the American Diabetes Association, 1.25 million U.S. children and adults have type 1 diabetes. <br>
    Type 2 diabetes affects the body’s ability to use insulin properly. Unlike people with type 1 diabetes, people with type 2 diabetes make insulin. However, either they don’t make enough to keep up with rising blood sugar levels or their body isn’t able to use the insulin effectively. Doctors associate type 2 diabetes with lifestyle-related factors like obesity. <br>
    Gestational diabetes is a condition that causes women to have very high blood sugar levels during pregnancy. This condition is typically temporary.</p>
